Hazel is a Ph.D. Student Researcher based in East Lansing, Michigan. 

## Collaboration statement
My research interests involve interdisciplinary methods to improve plant conservation, such as data science, open science, plant community ecology, spatial ecology, remote sensing, and biogeography. I use plant functional traits to answer questions of plant biodiversity patterns across space and time.
